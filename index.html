				<h2>About</h2>

				<div class="candidate-content">

					<p>Jim Cooper was born and raised in Tennessee. He and Martha, his wife of twenty eight years, live
						in Nashville and have three children.</p>

					<p>A <strong>New York Times</strong> columnist recently called him <em>"the House's conscience, a
							lonely voice for civility in this ugly era"</em> and a <em>"tart-tongued moderate"</em> who
						<em>"seeks bipartisanship on fiscal matters and other issues in a polarized political
							climate."</em> <strong>USA Today</strong> named him one of the <em>"Brave 38" of a "tiny
							band of heroes"</em> in Congress for his work on a bipartisan budget plan.</p>

					<p>In Congress, he's known for his work on the federal budget, health care and government reform.
					</P>

				<h2>District</h2>
		
				<div class="candidate-content">
					<strong>District 5, Tennesee</strong>
					<p>District 5, Tennesee is located slightly northwest of the state's geographical center. It is
						currently composed of Davidson and Dickson counties, as well as most of Cheatham County. It is
						the only Tennessee congressional district which does not border another state.</P>


					<p>The district stretches west of Nashville, and into Cheatham and Dickson counties, which are far
						less suburbanized than the communities to the south and east of Nashville.</p>
					<p>The 5th is historically a very safe seat for the Democratic Party, due almost entirely to the
						influence of heavily Democratic Nashville. Some pockets of Republican influence exist in Belle
						Meade, and portions of neighboring Cheatham County. However, they are no match for the
						overwhelming Democratic trend in most of Nashville.

						No Republican has represented Nashville in Congress since Horace Harrison in 1875. </p>

			<p>You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell
				everyone. How it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But then why fifty years in
				the future when the spacecraft encounters a black hole does the computer call it an 'unknown
				entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't know, that means we never told anyone. And if
				we never told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of
				deductive logic. </p>
			<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show
				that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if
				they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
				don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>
